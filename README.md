# Introduction

This project is the Big Bag n Go technical test.  
The goal is to create an e-commerce app.

# Get started

To run the project, make sure to have docker and docker-compose installed on your machine. Then, run:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

Once containers are ready to go (it can takes a few minutes), you can access the e-commerce in your browser at `http://localhost:8080`.
